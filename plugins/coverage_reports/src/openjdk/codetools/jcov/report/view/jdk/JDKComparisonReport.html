<h1>JDK coverage comparison report</h1>
<p>The reports shows difference in coverage between two code coverage collections done on the same build.
    For simplicity, let's call the two coverage collections as <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>. An example of a use case
would be comparing coverage of two groups of tests targeting the same code.</p>

<h2>The report</h2>
<p>The report simultaneously compares coverage for the methods and the source code. Only methods and the code which
    are present in the <b>right</b> collection are displayed in the report. Color coding is used to indicate coverage differences.</p>

Next coloring is used (same coloring used for methods and source lines unless otherwise specified):
<ul>
    <li><a class="item_both">Both</a> - Code covered by both <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> code coverage collections.</li>
    <li><a class="item_left">Left</a> - Code only covered by <b>left</b>.</li>
    <li><a class="item_right">Right</a> - Code only covered by <b>right</b>.</li>
    <li><a class="item_none">None</a> - Code not covered by either <b>left</b> or <b>right</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Views</h3>
There are two views in the report:
<h4>Folder view</h4>
<p>At the top of the view, with the esception of the root view, there is a navgation bar, which takes back up the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Following that there are stats on method coverage for all four groups: covered, uncovered, lost and new.</p>
<p>Following that, there is an information on line coverage for the files in that folder (recursively).</p>
<p>Following that, there is a table of sub-folders for each of which there are stats on method coverage for all four groups
and line coverage for every sub-folder. Clicking on a column header allows to sort the list by this column values in a
    descending or an ascending order. Clicking on a folder name takes to the next level.
<p>Finally there is a table with files located in this folder. It displays the same information for every file: all four
kinds of method coverage plus line coverage for every method. Clicking on a file name takes to a file view</p>

<h4>File view</h4>
<p>At the top of the view, with the esception of the root view, there is a navgation bar, which takes back up the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Following that there is a list of methods in alphabetical order colored according to the method
coverage status. (Please note that VM method signatures are used). Clicking on a method name takes to the first
line of the source code corresponding to this method.</p>
<p>Following that there is line coverage information for the file.</p>
<p>Following that there is file source, colored according to the coverage status. Left to every line of code which
is a code line and is not new, there is one or more "_" clickable links which take to the method in the list at the top
    of the view. Mouse hovering over a "_" link brings a tooltip with the signature of the method.</p>
