<h1>JDK coverage comparison report</h1>
<p>The reports shows difference in coverage between two JDK code coverage collections. For simplicity, let's
    call the two coverage collections as <b>first</b> and <b>second</b>.</p>
<p>Examples of use cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comparing change in coverage over time.</li>
    <li>Comparing coverage from different test sets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The report</h2>
<p>The report simultaneously compares coverage for the methods and the source code. Only methods and the code which
    are present in the second collection are displayed in the report. Color coding is used to indicate coverage differences.</p>

Next coloring is used (same coloring used for methods and source lines unless otherwise specified):
<ul>
    <li><a class="item_good">Green, a.k.a covered</a> - exists in both versions and covered in the second version.</li>
    <li><a class="item_so_so">Yellow a.k.a. uncovered</a> - exists in both versions and covered in neither version.</li>
    <li><a class="item_not_so_good">Red a.k.a. lost</a> - exists in both versions, covered in the first but not is the second.</li>
    <li><a class="item_ignore">Grey a.k.a. new</a> - only exists in the second version. This is only used for methods,
        code which is only present in the second version has no color highlight.</li>
</ul>

The report only includes source code for classes which are present in the <b>second</b> coverage data.

<h3>Views</h3>
There are two views in the report:
<h4>Folder view</h4>
<p>At the top of the view, with the esception of the root view, there is a navgation bar, which takes back up the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Following that there are stats on method coverage for all four groups: covered, uncovered, lost and new.</p>
<p>Following that, there is an information on line coverage for the files in that folder (recursively).</p>
<p>Following that, there is a table of sub-folders for each of which there are stats on method coverage for all four groups
and line coverage for every sub-folder. Clicking on a column header allows to sort the list by this column values in a
    descending or an ascending order. Clicking on a folder name takes to the next level.
<p>Finally there is a table with files located in this folder. It displays the same information for every file: all four
kinds of method coverage plus line coverage for every method. Clicking on a file name takes to a file view</p>

<h4>File view</h4>
<p>At the top of the view, with the esception of the root view, there is a navgation bar, which takes back up the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Following that there is a list of methods in alphabetical order colored according to the method
coverage status. (Please note that VM method signatures are used). Clicking on a method name takes to the first
line of the source code corresponding to this method.</p>
<p>Following that there is line coverage information for the file.</p>
<p>Following that there is file source, colored according to the coverage status. Left to every line of code which
is a code line and is not new, there is one or more "_" clickable links which take to the method in the list at the top
    of the view. Mouse hovering over a "_" link brings a tooltip with the signature of the method.</p>
