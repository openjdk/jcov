<h1>Method coverage comparison report</h1>
<p>This report compares method coverage between two code coverage collections. A <i>target</i>
    coverage is compared to a <i>reference</i> coverage. Coverage of every method
    from the <i>target</i> collection is then compared to coverage of the same method in the <i>reference</i> collection.</p>
<p>A typical use for the report would be to investigate changes in method coverage
    over time, in which case the <i>reference</i> collection would be performed in the past and
    the <i>target</i> collection is recent.</p>
<p>Every method in the report marked in one of four ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a class="item_good">Covered</a> - methods that are covered in the <i>target</i> coverage collection</li>
    <li><a class="item_so_so">Uncovered</a> - methods that are not covered in either <i>target</i> or <i>reference</i> collections</li>
    <li><a class="item_not_so_good">Lost</a> - methods that are covered in the <i>reference</i> collection but are not covered in the <i>target</i> collection</li>
    <li><a class="item_ignore">New</a> - methods that are present in the <i>target</i> collection and missing in the <i>reference</i> collection</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the method coverage, the report provides line coverage from the <i>target</i> collection.</p>
<h2>Folder view</h2>
<p>A folder view lists total number of method for all four groups of methods for the files nested
    hierarchically within this folders.</p>
<p>Next the view shows direct <b>sub-folders</b> of this folder along with the totals for the groups of methods and
    total line coverage. The table is sortable by any column. Clicking on a sub-folder name takes to a folder view
    for that sub-folder. The table may be omitted altogether should tere be no direct sub-folders.</p>
<p>Next the view shows direct <b>files</b> which are located directly in this folder along with the totals for the
    groups of methods and total line coverage for the file. The table is sortable by any column. Clicking on a
    file name takes to a file view for that file.</p>
<h2>File view</h2>
<p>A file view lists methods of the file, colored in accordance to the groups to which the methods belong.
    Clicking on a method signature takes to the first line of the method, according to the line table
    from the bytecode.</p>
<p>Next there is the file source code. The source code is colored according to line coverage from the <i>target</i>
    collection:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a class="covered">covered</a></li>
    <li><a class="uncovered">uncovered</a></li>
    <li>no information on the text</li>
</ul>
    <p>Every line of the source code, which, according to the line table, is nested within one or more method,
        is prepended by one or more links, which lead to a corresponding method at the top of the file view.
        Every such link is colored the same way as the method it links to. Hovering mouse over such link
        displays method signature to which the link corresponds.</p>
